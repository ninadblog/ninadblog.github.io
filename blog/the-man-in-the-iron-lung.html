            <p>This is the man in the iron lung, Paul Alexander (born 1946). He is a polio survivor and one of the last
                people living in an iron lung. He contracted polio in 1952 at the age of 6 and paralyzed for life, only
                able to move his head, neck
                and mouth. When his parents noticed he was not able to breath, they rushed him to the hospital. During
                that time, it was the worst outbreak of polio in history. Since then, he has been taking help of a
                machine called iron lung which
                uses negative pressure to stimulate breathing to the patients. Despite his illness, he was home-schooled
                and graduated second in his class in 1967. He got his bachelor's degree from University of Texas in
                1978, then his J.D. (law)
                degree in 1984 and became a lawyer.</p>
            <p>After leaving the hospital, Paul came to his residence in Dallas, Texas. But his life was never going to
                be the same. He couldn't play sports and hang out with his friends. People didn't like him much. They
                would find very uncomfortable
                around him. He remembers about the doctors talk when they walked through on their rounds. “He's going to
                die today,” they said. “He shouldn't be alive.” It made him furious. It made him want to live.</p>
            <p>This would make anyone feel like giving up. But Paul didn't want to die. He just continued to fight. He
                did everything he could. He fought against polio every day. It was hard, painful and tiring. But he
                didn't stop there. Paul wrote his
                own biography with a pen attached to a stick, entirely with his mouth. The book named <i>Three Minutes
                    for a Dog</i> was released in April 2020. It took him more than eight years to write it, using the
                stick to tap out his story on
                the keyboard, or dictating the words to his friends. He wants to inspire thousands of people like us.

                style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; height:378px; width:666px"><br>
            <p>In an interview, Paul said:</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="bq-text">No matter where you're from or what your past is, or the challenges that you could be
                    facing, you can truly do anything. You've just got to set your mind to it and work hard!
                </p>
                <p class="bq-text">My story, is an example of why your past or even your disability does not have to
                    define your future.</p>
            </blockquote><br>
            <p>Paul's dream is to not let polio defeat him but to defeat polio. He wanted to accomplish the thing he was
                told he couldn't and achieve the dream he dreamed.</p>
            <p>Paul may have an iron lung, but he has a golden soul, and a diamond heart!</p>
