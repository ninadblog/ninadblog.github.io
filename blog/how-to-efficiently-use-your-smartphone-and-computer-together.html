            <!--Start writing here-->
            <p>We all use smartphone and computer to complete our day-to-day tasks. Android is the most popular
                operating system in smartphone market. On the other hand, Windows has the largest userbase in personal
                computers. So as these are the popular
                OS then why can we not use them together seamlessly?
            </p>
            <p>So, I am going to discuss some of the ways you can share data from your phone to your PC and vice versa.
                Not only that, you can also use these devices as one ecosystem like what Apple has their own.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Transfer Files</b><br> There is no perfect working files sharing feature between Android and
                    Windows. Some rumours suggest that Chrome browser in Windows 10 will feature nearby share. This
                    feature is available on Android for some
                    time now and it will be useful to have it on PC. Here are some steps and software/apps which will
                    ease the process of sharing files.</li><br>
                <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                    <li><b>Bluetooth</b><br> This might sound pretty old but it can be helpful if you don't want to
                        download extra apps on your PC and mobile. As the speeds are slow it is useless for larger
                        files. You can quickly share some photos and
                        audio files.</li><br>
                    <li><b>AirDroid</b><br> AirDroid is one of the most popular apps to share files. Apart from this it
                        can send and receive SMS from your phone and show you your device's notification on your PC.
                        It's free and you have to pay to the subscription
                        to use all its services.
                        <br>Free|Subscription: $1.99 per month.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Resilio Sync</b><br> Resilio Sync works like a cloud storage but data is stored locally on
                        your PC. You can sync/transfer as much data as you want. This app is free for limited use. You
                        can pay one time to unlock all its features
                        and services.
                        <br>Free|One-time purchase $75
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Google Drive</b><br> Drive is a cloud-based storage service. You can upload files and backup
                        your mobile data. You can create link and send large files to others. The free version only
                        provides 15 GB of storage. You need to
                        pay to the subscription to get more storage.<br> Free|Subscription at $1.99 for 100 GB per month
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Smash</b><br> As Google Drive gives you 15 GB of storage, Smash gives you unlimited storage.
                        You can send unlimited files of unlimited sizes to any system and anyone without even signup.
                        Smash keeps your files for only 14 days
                        which is not bad.<br> Free
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Not to forget our old school USB cables. They can transfer files at the highest speeds :)</p><br>
                <li><b>Sync browser tabs and open link seamlessly</b><br> Many times, we need to open links from phone
                    to our computers. You may have used WhatsApp Web to send link cross platform. Instead use backup and
                    sync on Chrome. Here's how to do
                    that:<br>
                </li>
                <ul class="post-list">
                    <li>First login to your same Google account on Chrome on both the devices.</li>
                    <li>Then go to settings --> Sync and Google services --> Turn Sync your Chrome data on.</li>
                    <li>When you click share button on Chrome there's an option named Send to your devices. Click it and
                        select your device. The link will instantly pop up on your other device. Chrome also backups
                        your saved passwords and logins for websites.
                        It has wide variety of Extensions.

                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If you are privacy-focussed then try Mozilla Firefox or Brave browser. These browsers provide similar
                    features. The main advantage is that they block tracking of websites so you can browse without
                    concerning about your privacy.</p>

            </ol>
