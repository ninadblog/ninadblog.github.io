            <!--Start writing here-->
            <p class="post-para">A month ago, I watched a mind-blowing documentary <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mqR_e2seeM" target="_blank"><i>The Social Dilemma</i></a> on
                YouTube. It was worth watching and shows you the real business behind the tech companies.
                Inspired by that, I thought of writing down the important topics discussed in the documentary and my own
                thoughts. Before proceeding, let's peak into the history first.</p>
            <p class="post-para">The internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share
                information. It was not until 1991 when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
                (WWW). He created the browser to access the web and made
                publicly available. That's when internet reached to the common people all around the world. At first,
                people could only send emails to communicate with other people on the internet. This version of web was
                named as Web 1.0. After the
                rise of social networking sites like SixDegrees, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.
                Then new version was made named Web 2.0. </p>

            </blockquote>
            <p class="post-para">Since every coin has two sides, the advantages of social media are worth mentioning. It
                is easy to find new people of same interest, talent or profession. On social media sites like Facebook,
                we can find the groups of our interest, follow
                influencers and make new friends from anywhere in the world. Sharing ideas, creating new things, talking
                about serious topics, spreading awareness around the globe and many more things have been made possible
                by the community on the
                internet. Some creators crowdfund for good cause and needy ones managed to get organs with the help of
                the social media. During the global pandemic, many people seek out hobbies, interest, attend live
                concert online, connect with friends
                on video call and educate themselves with genuine news about the pandemic.</p>
            <p class="post-para">Internet is a volatile place. One can never predict what would possibly happen in very
                short span of time. With over 4.5 billion people on the internet, a large number information is shared
                on the web which can be accessed by everyone
                on the web. As the consequence, there's a lot of content uploaded every single second. If not regulated
                properly, anyone can read the content which leads to misuse of the shared information. People might get
                exposed to age-restricted
                content, fake news, conspiracies, illegal digital materials, and many more. Speaking of fake news,
                Covid-19 fake news spread faster than virus itself. There was violence, protests in many countries. In
                fact, people didn't cooperate
                with local authority which made even more difficult to curb the virus. As a result, social media can be
                useful at a certain extent but it can surely overwhelm us.</p>
            <p class="post-para">Social media addiction is another major problem especially among teenagers. According
                to Addiction Center, social media addiction looks much like any other substance disorder and may include
                mood modification, behavioural and emotional
                changes, ever-increasing use of social media, experiencing unpleasant physical and emotional symptoms
                when social media use is restricted and conflict. These trillion dollars-per year companies produce the
                same sense as of gambling
                and drugs to keep users using their products as much as possible. We have seen people considering the
                amount of likes and comments on their posts and worrying about it, constantly checking their social
                media apps. We tend to make a
                lot friends online but the question is whether they are our real friends. We chat a lot on Instagram,
                Messenger, and WhatsApp but definitely don't know the mood, expression, emotion and attention of the
                person with whom we are texting.
                Talking in front of that person makes the conversation real because we can see their body gestures,
                look, voice, etc. Teenagers are facing more depression, anxiety and loneliness than ever.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="bq-text">Likes just changed from spreading love around the world to making teenagers
                    depressed.
                </p>

            <p class="post-para">Big tech corporation are very good at making their products as addictive as possible.
                These companies collect a huge amount of data even if you are not using their products. Facebook and
                Instagram collect your browsing history, posts you
                like, people you follow, your exact location, news you read and undoubtedly sell these data to
                advertising companies to show you ads. It seems fine as these platforms run on advertising business
                models but it's hard to imagine the
                amount of data collected and processed to target us with relevant ads. Not only that, intruders can
                attack these platforms and steal users' data. In Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook
                confirmed that data of potentially
                87 million users was collected without the users' consent for political advertising. The data contained
                users' profile photo, birthday, current city, page likes, news feed, timeline, messages and 5000
                different data points. The data
                was detailed enough to create psychographic profiles of the users. As mentioned in popular documentary
                <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80117542" target="_blank"><i>The Great Hack</i></a>, Cambridge
                Analytica is just the tip
                of the iceberg.</p>

            <p class="post-para">Internet was created to decentralize the mode of communication which means there is web
                of network and even if anyone network collapses, the internet does not get disrupt. Contrary to this,
                internet is mostly centralized by tech companies
                like Facebook and Google today. Most of the people feel internet is Facebook and Google and they are not
                wrong. During the recent Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp outage, many people suffer because businesses
                work on it. People could
                not log into other web services with Facebook. Therefore, it is clear that Facebook has created monopoly
                throughout the internet.

            <p class="post-para">Now it is our responsibility to control the use of social media. No one would suggest
                to delete social media accounts to everyone. But even if few people do, it matters a lot. Here are the
                suggestions for everyone:</p>
            <ol class="post-list">
                <li>Turn off all the notifications. Don't let unnecessary stuff disturb your peaceful mind.</li>
                <li>Turn off any personalised ads option.</li>
                <li>Check many times before posting anything online. Even if you delete it later, it still remains in
                    the system.</li>
                <li>Don't spread news which are not true. Fact-check it always on Google or any other trusted source.
                </li>
                <li>Set screen time limits on your phone.</li>
                <li>Avoid keeping your phone in the bedroom at night.</li>
                <li>Don't watch what YouTube recommends you, always search for the video.</li>
                <li>Keep social media apps out of your sight which means out of your home screen.</li>
                <li>If you feel uncomfortable, talk about it with seniors.</li>
                <li>Take your time. Do something exciting. Read a book, go for a walk.</li>
                <li>Make friends in your neighbourhood.</li>
                <li>Lastly, get out of these AI-generated world. Look outside. The world is beautiful.</li>
